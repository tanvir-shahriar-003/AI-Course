Purpose of this Course
This course provided a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles and techniques of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The goal was to build a strong theoretical understanding of how intelligent agents perceive, reason, and act, complemented by hands-on lab sessions to implement core algorithms and build simple AI-driven games.

What I Learned from this Course
Throughout this course, I gained knowledge across a wide spectrum of AI topics, which can be categorized as follows:

Foundations of AI:

How the human mind works and the philosophical question of non-human minds.
Various definitions of AI (acting humanly, thinking humanly, thinking rationally, acting rationally).
The concept of an Agent and its role in an environment.
Intelligent Agents:

Types of agents: Simple Reflex Agent, Model-Based Reflex Agent, Goal-Based Agent, Utility-Based Agent, and Learning Agent.
The goals of an agent and the different Approaches to AI (e.g., cognitive science, law of thought, rational agent).
Characteristics of different Types of Environments (fully/partially observable, deterministic/stochastic, etc.).
Problem-Solving through Search Algorithms:

State Space Search as a fundamental problem-solving method.
Uninformed Search Algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Depth-Limited Search (DLS), Iterative Deepening Search (IDS), and Bidirectional Search.
Problem applications like the 8-Puzzle problem (without heuristic) and the N-Queen problem.
Heuristic and Informed Search:

The role of Heuristics in AI.
Applying heuristics to the 8-Puzzle problem.
Informed Search Algorithms: Best-First Search, A Search Algorithm* (and its admissibility), and the AO Algorithm*.
Optimization and Game Theory:

Hill Climbing Algorithm for optimization.
Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) and techniques like Bound Propagation and Backtracking.
Adversarial Search for games: Min-Max Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning.
The Beam Search algorithm.
Duration of this Course
The course was conducted over a single academic semester from July 2025 to December 2025
