AI Tools Exploration
This folder contains a video and a presentation slide deck created for the AI course, as per the project guidelines. The creation of both assets leveraged various AI tools to demonstrate their practical application in content creation.

1. Video: "A Journey Through Artificial Intelligence: Theory & Practice"
Tools Used & Creation Process:
Script Writing:

Tool: ChatGPT (GPT-4)
Process: I provided the AI with a list of the course topics and the requirement for a 1.5-minute video script blending theory and lab work. The AI generated a structured script outline which I then refined and edited for clarity and flow.
Reference: OpenAI ChatGPT
Visual Asset Generation:

Tool: Midjourney & Canva AI Image Generator
Process: I used these AI image generators to create custom, royalty-free visuals for the video. Prompts included "animated icon for breadth-first search algorithm," "futuristic AI concept art," and "flowchart of a utility-based agent."

Voiceover Generation:

Tool: ElevenLabs
Process: I input the final script into ElevenLabs, selected a clear and professional-sounding voice, and generated the audio file for the entire video.

Video Editing & Assembly:

Tool: HeyGen / Canva AI Video Generator
Process: Using HeyGen, I synced the generated voiceover with an AI avatar presenter. In Canva, I assembled the sequence using the generated images, screen recordings from my projects, and the AI-generated voiceover, adding transitions and background music from the platform's library.

2. Presentation Slide Deck
Tools Used & Creation Process:
Slide Design and Content Structuring:

Tool: Gamma & ChatGPT
Process: I used Gamma, an AI-powered presentation tool, to generate the initial slide deck. I provided it with the course topic list and the key requirements (10-12 slides, mix of theory and lab). I then used ChatGPT to help brainstorm concise bullet points and explanations for complex topics like "AO* Algorithm" and "Bound Propagation."

Visual Enhancement:

Tool: Beautiful.AI & Canva
Process: I used these tools to apply consistent and professional design templates. Their AI design assistants helped in automatically formatting content and suggesting relevant icons and layouts for different slide types (e.g., comparison, timeline, summary).
